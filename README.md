# Game of Life

This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life),
everyone's favourite cellular automaton. Kill or bring to life cells by clicking on them, press P to toggle
pausing the simulation, and press R to reset. G shows or hides the grid outline.

The 'GOL' folder contains a series of sample patterns to try.
